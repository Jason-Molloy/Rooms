# Rooms
A small text adventure game
In order to win, you will first have to realize you are Santa. From the roof you need to go down the chimney 
(any other direction will loose you the game in a humorous way).
In the Living room take the goodies and use them to stuff the stockings.
Do not go down the hallway.
Go into the kitchen and take and eat the cookies. Taking the sandwich or going out the back door will loose.
Once you have the whistle, you can go back to the roof to whistle for your sleigh and win.
